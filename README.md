# Statistical-Arbitrage-via-Bayesian-method
RUC course project: Advanced Statistical Analysis in Spring 2023.

# File description

Folder **Code** contains the main code for this project, where **Select_Stock.R** helps us to select stocks by clustering covariance. **Bayes_in_sample.R**, **Bayes_out_of_sample.R**, **Non-Bayes_in_sample.R** and **Non-Bayes_out_of_sample.R** denote the in-sample using Bayesian method, out-of-sample using Bayesian method, in-sample using conventional method and out-of-sample using conventional method for R programs. **Alpha.R** uses the S&P 500 index as the underlying to observe the excess returns of our method.

**bbk.us.txt**, **bfy.us.txt**, **ko.us.txt** and **pep.us.txt** are the main data I use in my project. More data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-.

Folder **Images** provide the main results of my report.

File **Slides.pdf** is the slides of my presentation. There is a mistake in the slides and I have corrected it in my final report.

File **Final project.pdf** is the final report.

# Conclusions

If stock pairs with co-integration relationships are selected, the use of Bayesian methods can improve on conventional statistical arbitrage in terms of return will maximum drawdown.

# Acknowledgement

The author thanks Prof. Ma Wei for his insightful comments and valuable suggestions that improve my final report. The author also thanks the provider of the dataset that allows my analysis to proceed.
